<h3 class="section">2.8 Multi Threading</h3>

<p><a name="index-thread_002dsafeness-17"></a><a name="index-multi_002dthreading-18"></a>
The <acronym>GPGME</acronym> library is not entirely thread-safe, but it can
still be used in a multi-threaded environment if some care is taken. 
If the following requirements are met, there should be no race
conditions to worry about:

     <ul>
<li><acronym>GPGME</acronym> supports the thread libraries pthread and GNU Pth. 
The support for this has to be enabled at compile time. 
<acronym>GPGME</acronym> will automatically detect the location in which the
thread libraries are installed and activate the support for them at
build time.

     <p>Support for other thread libraries is very easy to add.  Please
contact us if you have the need.

     <li>If you want to use <acronym>GPGME</acronym> with threads, you must link to the
right version of the library.  The name of the right library is
<code>libgpgme-</code> followed by the name of the thread package you use. 
For example, if you use GNU Pth, the right name is
<code>libgpgme-pth</code>.  Use the Automake macros or
<samp><span class="command">gpgme-config</span></samp> program for simplicity.

     <li>The function <code>gpgme_check_version</code> must be called before any
other function in the library, because it initializes the thread
support subsystem in <acronym>GPGME</acronym>.  To achieve this in
multi-threaded programs, you must synchronize the memory with respect
to other threads that also want to use <acronym>GPGME</acronym>.  For this, it
is sufficient to call <code>gpgme_check_version</code> before creating the
other threads using <acronym>GPGME</acronym><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

     <li>Any <code>gpgme_data_t</code> and <code>gpgme_ctx_t</code> object must only be
accessed by one thread at a time.  If multiple threads want to deal
with the same object, the caller has to make sure that operations on
that object are fully synchronized.

     <li>Only one thread at any time is allowed to call <code>gpgme_wait</code>.  If
multiple threads call this function, the caller must make sure that
all invocations are fully synchronized.  It is safe to start
asynchronous operations while a thread is running in gpgme_wait.

     <li>The function <code>gpgme_strerror</code> is not thread safe.  You have to
use <code>gpgme_strerror_r</code> instead. 
</ul>

   <div class="footnote">

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> At least this is true for
POSIX threads, as <code>pthread_create</code> is a function that
synchronizes memory with respects to other threads.  There are many
functions which have this property, a complete list can be found in
POSIX, IEEE Std 1003.1-2003, Base Definitions, Issue 6, in the
definition of the term &ldquo;Memory Synchronization&rdquo;.  For other thread
packages other, more relaxed or more strict rules may apply.</p>
