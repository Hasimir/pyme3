Package: python-pyme
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends}

Description: Python interface to the GPGME GnuPG encryption library
 This is a "dummy" package that will cause the Pyme package for Debian's
 default Python version to always be present on your system.

Package: python2.2-pyme
Architecture: any
Depends: python2.2, ${shlibs:Depends}
Suggests: python-pyme-doc
Description: Python interface to the GPGME GnuPG encryption library
 Pyme is, for the most part, a direct interface to the C GPGME
 library.  However, it is re-packaged in a more Pythonic way --
 object-oriented with classes and modules.  Take a look at the classes
 defined here -- they correspond directly to certain object types in GPGME
 for C.
 .
 Features:
 * Feature-rich, full implementation of the GPGME library.  Supports
   all GPGME features except interactive editing (coming soon).
   Callback functions may be written in pure Python.
 .
 * Ability to sign, encrypt, decrypt, and verify data.
 .
 * Ability to list keys, export and import keys, and manage the keyring.
 .
 * Fully object-oriented with convenient classes and modules.
 .
 This package is for Python 2.2.
